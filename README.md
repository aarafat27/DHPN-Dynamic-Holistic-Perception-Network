# Dynamic Holistic Perception Networks for Enhanced Object RecognitionDHPN-Model-for-Object-Recognition
A novel neural network architecture that emulates the human brain's ability to perceive objects holistically. Unlike traditional AI models that process images through fixed mechanisms (e.g., pixel-based in CNNs or patch-based in Vision Transformers), this architecture dynamically integrates both global (whole-object) and local (part-based) features based on the complexity and context of the input. The model leverages attention mechanisms to adaptively focus on different aspects of an image, enabling more efficient and accurate object recognition, especially in complex or abstract scenes.

**Problem Addressed:** Current AI models often rely on fixed processing paradigms (local or patch-based), which can limit their ability to generalize and accurately recognize objects in varied contexts.

**Solution Provided:** Introduces a dynamic processing mechanism that allows the model to switch between holistic and part-based perception, similar to human cognitive processes.

**Dynamic Integration:** Unlike existing models, this architecture can dynamically adjust its focus between global and local features during inference.

**Biologically Inspired:** Incorporates principles from human holistic perception and Gestalt psychology to enhance AI's object recognition capabilities.

**Adaptive Attention Mechanism:** Utilizes a novel attention-based module that determines the optimal processing strategy based on input complexity and context.
